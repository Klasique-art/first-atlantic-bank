      description: `The 2000s represented the height of traditional banking in Ghana, and like many parts of the world, it was defined by long, winding queues in brick-and-mortar banking halls. Customers often had to dedicate an entire morning or afternoon to complete a simple transaction. The environment was typically crowded, with numbered tickets, endless waiting, and bank tellers buried in mountains of paperwork. Passbooks, cheque books, and physical cash ruled the day. It was not uncommon for a customer to be told to return the next day because ‚Äúthe system was down.‚Äù Transactions were handled manually, leaving room for human error and security lapses. There was a strong human element to it‚Äîrelationships with personal bankers mattered‚Äîbut the experience was far from efficient. People lived around the bank‚Äôs operating hours, and for the working class, accessing your own money meant sacrificing precious time. This was an era where banking was rigid, reactive, and dependent on location, yet deeply familiar to everyone who lived through it.`

      description: `The 2010s brought a wave of transformation that shifted the foundation of banking into the palms of customers. Mobile banking started as a novelty‚Äîsomething only the tech-savvy explored‚Äîbut quickly grew into a necessity. With the rise of mobile phones, especially in Africa, banks began introducing USSD services and basic mobile apps. Customers could suddenly perform actions like checking account balances, transferring funds, and purchasing airtime without stepping foot in a banking hall. This dramatically increased banking accessibility for both urban professionals and remote communities. It was the beginning of self-service banking‚Äîtransactions were now in your control, anytime, anywhere. Mobile banking reduced reliance on human tellers, shortened turnaround times, and expanded financial services to a wider population. However, the digital shift also came with growing pains: concerns about security, low smartphone penetration, and the learning curve for less tech-literate users. Despite this, the decade was pivotal‚Äîit broke down walls and opened the gates to what banking could truly become: agile, inclusive, and 24/7.`
